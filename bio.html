			<h3>Visual Communications Design</h3>
				<h5>Why this major?</h5>
					<p>I am majoring in Visual Communications Design with a minor in Coaching. I have chosen this major because all my life all I have wanted to be is a coach, hence the coaching minor. If I could not be a coach I wanted to be involved in athletics and photography seemed like the next best option. I did not know what exactly I wanted to focus on with my degree until I took my first Photography class. After that point in time I learned that I had a LOT to learn but it was exactly what I wanted to do. I also learned that in order to be a good photographer I had to be a good designer, and this is what really confirmed for me that Visual Communications design is what I want to do for my major.</p>
				<h5> What is my Focus?</h5>
					  <p>My direct focus behind obtaining this degree is more related to one of the sub-categories we study as a VCD (Visual Communications Design) student, Photography, more specifically Sports Photography. While Photography is my focus behind obtaining my degree understanding the elements of design plays a role in not only photography but succeeding as a photographer. In order to be able to succeed I have to be able to sell my work and I can either pay someone else to do this for me, or I can gain experience in how to do these things myself and present and design my work in the way that I feel it best sells who I am and what I do.</p>
				<h5>More about my major?</h5>
					 <p>Many people do not understand what this means, however, if you brake down the title of the Major it becomes relatively simple. Communication through Visual means of Design. Using things that we see every day and do not give a second thought to and understanding how the structure, formatting, colors and full elements of design to communicate a specific idea.</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>I have been with the love of my life since I was 14 years old. We got married after being together for 5 years and after being married together for a year almost to the day my son was born. We are now seniors at <a href="">Eastern Washington University</a> me obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Communications Design and him a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Going to school with a child has been hard but it gave us both a purpose to have a better future to be able to provide for him and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
